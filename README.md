# JIP Ethereal Matter Unity
This repository is for work done to complete the Joint Interdisciplinary Project. During this project we worked in a team of 3 students in order to help Ethereal Matter further develop their product: the immersive VR fitness experience.

Code within this repository is for the Unity game engine and mostly involves a DTW algorithm that is used to compare motion in real-time. The goal was to basically compare movement in real life and tell the user if they are performing an exercise correctly.
